These examples illustrate the following:

* How to access one of the many sensors available on Gear S
* How to leverage the Tizen M2X client to push data to M2X
* How to use local storage (to save M2X settings)
* How to use Open Source libraries such as RequireJS, jQuery and CharJS to build a Gear S application

####IMPORTANT####
* You must replace the bogus M2X key in m2xclient.js with your own master key before building/running this demo. (search for 'new M2X') 
* For illustration purposes, M2XGPSDemo uses M2X V1 API library.
