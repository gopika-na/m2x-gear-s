These examples illustrate the following:

* How to access one of the many sensors available on Gear S
* How to leverage the Tizen M2X client to push data to M2X
* How to use local storage (to save M2X settings)
* How to use Open Source libraries such as RequireJS, jQuery and CharJS to build a Gear S application

####IMPORTANT####
Before building/running these demos, YOU MUST REPLACE the bogus M2X key in m2xclient.js with your own master key for both demo apps and the bogus Google Map key in locdata_map.js for the M2XGPSDemo app (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key)
